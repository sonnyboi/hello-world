    <h1>My First Webpage!</h1>
    <h2>HTML is fun!</h2>
    <p>
        I am learning HTML from <a href="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_200_200/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAcpAAAAJDA2ZmUwYTI4LWYwZGEtNDEzMS1iMWU3LWUxOGY3MmMwYTY5Mg.jpg">Ms. Smith</a> the coolest teacher I know! She is the director of the <a href="https://www.tagedonline.org/programs/exploring-stem-careers-pipeline-program/"> Pipeline Program at TAG Ed </a> - it's an awesome way to learn more about STEM.
    </p>
    <h3>I have learned many things.</h3>
    <p>
        I now have an overview of HTML and how it plays a huge role in websites.  I have looked at opening and closing tags, head, title and body tags, header tags, how to make links, and how to include images in my pages!
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm now completing my first project using my new-found knowledge and skills!
    </p>
    <h2>I can't wait to learn CSS!</h2>
    <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) will be of great use when learning to lay out and format the look of my web page.  I am looking forward to learning this and many other things as I continue in the Exploring STEM Careers Pipeline Program!
